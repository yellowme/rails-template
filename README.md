# Yellowme's opinionated Ruby on Rails
This is a rails template made with the intention to make projects creation even faster.

## Installation
To use this template you just have to run this command:

`rails new my-project -m https://github.com/yellowme/rails-template/blob/master/template.rb`

or if you have a project started already:

`rails app:template LOCATION=https://github.com/yellowme/rails-template/blob/master/template.rb`
